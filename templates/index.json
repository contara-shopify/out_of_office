            "text": "<p>Let's talk about Hemp-derived THC and its legal side. THC is a compound primarily found in the cannabis plant. It's the psychoactive component responsible for the \"high\" sensation commonly associated with marijuana use. However, when derived from hemp, a specific variety of the cannabis plant, THC takes on a different legal status. Thanks to the 2018 Farm Bill, Hemp-derived THC is considered legal as long as it contains no more than 0.3% by weight. This bill sets the rules for what's allowed when it comes to THC content in certain products. So, if you're staying within that 0.3% limit, you're on the right side of the legal fence.</p>"

Start off on the chill side with a low dose – this gives you a chance to gauge your body's vibes and dodge any overwhelming effects, especially if you're new to the THC scene. Give it some time (around 1 to 2 hours) to work its magic, and why not keep a little journal of your adventure?
